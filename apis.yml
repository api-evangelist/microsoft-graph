      Microsoft Graph Admin refers to the administrative capabilities exposed
      through Microsoft Graph that let IT teams manage and monitor Microsoft 365
      from a single, unified API. It enables you to provision and govern
      identities and access (users, groups, roles, licenses) in Microsoft Entra
      ID; manage devices and apps with Intune; configure and operate
      collaboration services like Teams, SharePoint, and Exchange; pull audit,
      usage, and security insights; and monitor service health and Message
      Center communications. With granular, consent-based permissions plus
      features like delta queries and webhooks, it supports automation of
      lifecycle tasks, policy enforcement at scale, reporting and analytics, and
      integration with CI/CD and ITSM workflows.

      Microsoft Graph Agreement Acceptances provides a read-only way to retrieve
      records of users’ responses to your organization’s Terms of Use configured
      in Microsoft Entra ID. Each acceptance entry is created automatically when
      a user (including guests) is prompted and captures who responded, which
      agreement and file version they saw, their response state (accepted or
      declined), the timestamp, and—if per‑device consent is required—the device
      information. Through Microsoft Graph you can list and filter these records
      (for example by userId or agreementId) to build compliance and audit
      reports, verify who accepted which terms and when, and integrate this
      evidence into governance, automation, or SIEM workflows.

      users, and require acceptance or periodic re-acceptance. Through
      Conditional Access, you can enforce that users (including guests) must
      accept terms before signing in or accessing specific apps. The API also
      provides detailed acceptance records—who accepted, when, which version,
      and often device/context—so you can audit compliance at scale and automate
      workflows around policy updates.

      Microsoft Graph Devices refers to the Microsoft Graph APIs that let you
      discover and manage devices across Azure Active Directory and Microsoft
      Intune from a single, unified endpoint. Through the /devices resource you
      can list and query Azure AD–registered or joined devices and their
      relationships (such as owners and registered users), and via
      /deviceManagement/managedDevices you can access rich inventory and state
      for Intune-managed devices, including platform, compliance, and health
      details. Beyond inventory, the Intune endpoints enable lifecycle and
      support actions—such as sync, retire, wipe, restart, remote lock, and
      more—subject to the appropriate permissions and device platform
      capabilities. Organizations use these APIs to build asset inventories,
      drive conditional access and app targeting, automate help‑desk workflows,
      and integrate device context into security and compliance processes across
      Windows, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Android.

      verificationDnsRecords (typically TXT or MX) used to prove ownership, and
      serviceConfigurationRecords (MX, CNAME, TXT, SRV) used to configure
      services like Exchange Online (mail flow and Autodiscover), Teams/Skype,
      and device management. Each record is typed (for example
      DomainDnsTxtRecord, DomainDnsCnameRecord, DomainDnsMxRecord,
      DomainDnsSrvRecord) and includes details such as host name, target, and
      TTL. Apps can read these records to guide admins, automate onboarding,

      Microsoft Graph Identity Protection exposes Microsoft Entra ID (formerly
      Azure AD) Identity Protection signals and controls through the Graph API
      so you can detect, investigate, and remediate identity risks at scale. It
      provides programmatic access to risk detections and risk levels for users,
      sign-ins, and service principals; surfaces indicators such as leaked
      credentials, unfamiliar sign-in properties, impossible travel,
      malware-linked or anonymous IPs, password spray, and token theft; and
      preserves risk history. Using the API, you can list and filter risky
      entities, confirm compromise or dismiss false positives, trigger
      remediation (for example, require password reset or MFA via risk-based
      policies), and manage Identity Protection policies to automate response.
      This enables integration with SIEM/SOAR and custom apps to monitor,
      triage, and enforce risk-based conditional access across your tenant.

      Microsoft Graph OAuth2 Permission Grants (the oAuth2PermissionGrant
      resource) are the consent records in Microsoft Entra ID that capture which
      delegated permissions (scopes) a client application’s service principal
      has to call a resource API on behalf of users. Each grant ties the client
      service principal to the resource service principal, indicates whether the
      consent is per-user (Principal) or tenant-wide via admin consent
      (AllPrincipals), and stores the space-delimited scopes and optional
      validity period. During token issuance, Entra ID relies on these grants to
      decide whether to issue an access token with the requested scopes;
      removing a grant prevents future tokens for those scopes and forces
      re-consent. Admins and automation use Microsoft Graph to list, audit,
      create, update, or revoke these grants to enforce least privilege and
      govern app access. Note that oAuth2PermissionGrant covers delegated
      permissions only; application permissions are represented separately by
      app role assignments (appRoleAssignment). These objects don’t contain
      tokens or secrets—they are authoritative consent records used by the

      Microsoft Graph permission grants are the records and APIs in Microsoft
      Entra ID that represent the consent an application has to access
      resources. They link a client app (service principal) to a resource API
      and the specific permissions approved, and are used during token issuance
      to determine what the app can do. There are two main forms: delegated
      permission grants (oAuth2PermissionGrant), which capture user-consented
      scopes or tenant-wide admin consent, and app role assignments, which
      capture application permissions for app-only access. Using Microsoft
      Graph, administrators can list, audit, create, and revoke these grants to
      manage app access, respond to risk, and enforce least-privilege practices.
      In short, permission grants operationalize consent by making it
      inspectable and controllable across the tenant.

      by URL, search for sites, and navigate a site’s structure to access
      document libraries (drives), lists, list items, files, and modern site
      pages. You can read and update metadata, columns, and content types;
      follow or unfollow sites; work with the term store (taxonomy); and relate
      a site to connected resources like users, groups, and Teams. Because it’s
      part of Microsoft Graph, you get consistent authentication, granular
      permissions, and cross-service capabilities, plus change tracking and
      webhooks on supported resources to build reliable, automated content and
      intranet solutions.

      Microsoft Graph solutions connect apps to the data and intelligence across
      Microsoft 365 through a single, unified API. They enable secure access to
      users, groups, mail, calendars, files, Teams chats and meetings,
      SharePoint, OneDrive, Planner, devices, and security signals, so you can
      build experiences that personalize collaboration, automate workflows, and
      derive insights. With SDKs, webhooks and change notifications, delta
      queries, Graph Connectors, and Graph Data Connect, you can integrate
      external systems, react to changes in near real time, and run analytics at
      scale—all governed by Microsoft Entra ID’s consent and granular
      permissions. The result is faster development, consistent security, and
      richer solutions embedded in Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, and custom
      line‑of‑business apps.

      “Microsoft Graph storage” typically refers to the storage capabilities
      exposed through Microsoft Graph—primarily OneDrive and SharePoint—via the
      Files and Drives APIs. It lets apps programmatically store and manage
      files and folders, upload and download (including large-file upload
      sessions), track changes with delta queries, generate thumbnails, search,
      and share content with rich permission controls. For app-specific data,
      developers can use the user’s OneDrive appFolder as a private per-app
      space, and attach custom metadata to Microsoft 365 entities using open or
      schema extensions. All of this is accessed through the Microsoft Graph
      REST API and SDKs with delegated or application permissions, inheriting
      Microsoft 365 security, compliance, and auditing.

      Microsoft Graph Subscribed SKUs is the API/resource that lists the
      Microsoft 365/Azure AD license subscriptions your tenant owns. When you
      call GET /subscribedSkus, it returns each license plan (SKU) with its
      identifiers (skuId, skuPartNumber), seat counts (prepaidUnits and
      consumedUnits), subscription status (enabled, suspended, warning), and the
      included service plans. This lets apps and admins inventory licenses, map
      SKU IDs to human-readable plans, check capacity before assigning licenses,
      spot suspended or trial subscriptions, and build usage or compliance
      reports. In practice, you read subscribed SKUs to choose the right skuId,
      then use Graph’s license assignment endpoints to add or remove that
      license for users or groups.

      Microsoft Graph Subscriptions let your app receive near real-time change
      notifications (webhooks) when Microsoft 365 data changes—such as Outlook
      mail and calendar items, users and groups, files in OneDrive/SharePoint,
      or Teams chats and channels. You register a subscription that specifies
      the resource to watch and a publicly reachable HTTPS endpoint; Microsoft
      Graph validates the endpoint and then posts notifications whenever
      relevant items are created, updated, or deleted. Subscriptions are
      time-limited and must be renewed, and notifications include information
      your app can use to verify authenticity and correlate events. You can
      receive a lightweight payload and fetch details via Graph, or include
      encrypted resource data directly in the notification. This enables
      reactive apps, workflows, and sync processes that trigger immediately on
      changes across Microsoft 365.

      Microsoft Graph Tenant Relationships is the part of the Microsoft Graph
      API that lets you model and manage how your Microsoft Entra ID tenant
      relates to other tenants. It provides endpoints to discover external
      tenants, create and govern delegated admin relationships (GDAP) between
      partners and customers, manage membership in a multi-tenant organization,
      and access “managed tenants” data used by Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. By
      centralizing these cross-tenant connections, it enables service providers
      and enterprises to automate onboarding, scope and assign permissions,
      monitor relationship status, and streamline operations and collaboration
      across many tenants in a consistent, policy-driven way.

      Microsoft Graph Users refers to the Users resource in Microsoft Graph,
      which exposes Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) user accounts and their
      relationships and Microsoft 365 data through a unified API. It lets you
      list, read, create, update, and delete users; manage identities and
      lifecycle tasks such as assigning licenses, resetting passwords, and
      updating authentication settings; and retrieve related information like
      profile details, photos, managers, direct reports, group and role
      memberships. From a user, you can also navigate to their mail, calendar,
      OneDrive files, tasks, and Teams-related data. The endpoint supports
      powerful queries and change tracking via OData options like $select,
      $filter, $search, and delta, as well as batching for efficiency. Access
      requires OAuth 2.0 with delegated or application permissions, and many
      write or sensitive read operations need admin consent and least-privilege
      scopes.
