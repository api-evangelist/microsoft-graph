        identified by the value of its id, this method retrieves the branding
        for the specified locale. This method retrieves only non-Stream
        properties, for example, usernameHintText and signInPageText. To
        retrieve Stream types of the default branding, for example, bannerLogo
        and backgroundImage, use the GET organizationalBrandingLocalization
        method.

Clients can use this API to determine whether a display name or mail nickname is valid before trying to create a Microsoft 365 group. To validate the properties of an existing group, use the group: validateProperties function. The following policy validations are performed for the display name and mail nickname properties:\r\n1. Validate the prefix and suffix naming policy\r\n2. Validate the custom banned words policy\r\n3. Validate that the mail nickname is unique This API only returns the first validation failure that is encountered. If the properties fail multiple validations, only the first validation failure is returned. However, you can validate both the mail nickname and the display name and receive a collection of validation errors if you're only validating the prefix and suffix naming policy.
